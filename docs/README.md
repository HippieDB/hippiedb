# The Free-Spirited, Shared key-value database for Everyone

## Welcome to HippieDB🌿
Imagine a world where databases aren’t locked behind paywalls or complicated setups. A world where everyone shares the same space, respects each other’s data, and vibes together in harmony.

That’s hippieDB, a free, open, and cloud-hosted Redis-like database for everyone. No accounts, no fees, no drama. Just connect, start storing your data, and let the good vibes flow.

## Why HippieDB?🌸
- Free as in freedom: No cost, no limits, no strings attached.
- Shared but respectful: Everyone uses the same database, but we trust each other to play nice.
- Instant access: Connect via TCP and start using it right away, no setup required.
- Redis-like: Works just like Redis, so you already know how to use it.

## How it Works✨
- Connect: Point your TCP client to hippiedb.groovy.ch and start storing data.
- Share: The database is shared by everyone, so keep it chill and respect others’ keys.
- Vibe: Enjoy the simplicity of a free, communal database that just works.

## The HippieDB Manifesto✌️
We believe in:

- Freedom: Software should be free and accessible to all.
- Community: Shared resources can work when we respect each other.
- Simplicity: No bloated features, no unnecessary complexity, just a database that works.
### Be Cool, Man
Remember, HippieDB is a shared space. Be kind, respect others’ data, and keep the vibes positive. Let’s show the world that a little trust and respect can go a long way.
