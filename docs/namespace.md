# Namespaces in HippieDB 🌈✌️

Welcome to the land of peace, love, and namespaces! In HippieDB, namespaces are like your own little patch of grass in the communal database garden. They help you avoid stepping on anyone else’s flowers (or data) and let you grow your own groovy stuff without hassle.

## Why Namespaces Are Far Out, Man 🌻
- **Avoid Bad Vibes**: Namespaces keep your keys chill and separate from others, so no one accidentally messes with your mojo.
- **Stay Organized, Man**: They help you keep your data as tidy as a tie-dye shirt collection.
- **Share the Love**: Namespaces let everyone coexist in harmony, like a big, happy database commune.

## Reserving Your Groovy Namespace 🕊️

First, check if your dream namespace is free, man:

```plaintext
get namespace_garden

```

If it’s wide open, claim it with good vibes:

```plaintext
set namespace_garden reserved by hiperbou
OK
```

Now you can start planting your data seeds in your namespace garden:

```plaintext
set garden.myVar 1
OK
get garden.myVar
1
```

## What If Someone Else is Hogging the Namespace? 🌿

If your desired namespace is already taken, don’t freak out, man! You can either pick another groovy name or ask the current reserver to share the love.

### Sending a Peaceful Request ✌️

If the namespace is already claimed, send a friendly request to the current reserver:

```plaintext
get namespace_garden
reserved by hiperbou

set namespace_garden_request hey, can I borrow this namespace? I promise to water the data plants!
OK
```

The current reserver will see your request:

```plaintext
get namespace_garden_request
hey, can I borrow this namespace? I promise to water the data plants!
```

They might ask you a question, like, who even are you, man?

```plaintext
set namespace_garden_request what’s your vibe, friend?
OK
```

You can reply with your groovy identity:

```plaintext
set namespace_garden_request just a fellow data hippie, dblover42 at your service!
OK
```

## Transferring the Namespace 🌈

If the current reserver is feeling generous, they can pass the namespace torch to you:

```plaintext
set namespace_garden reserved by dblover42
OK
```

They might even leave you a little note of encouragement:

```plaintext
set namespace_garden_request here you go, friend! may your data bloom like wildflowers!
OK
```

Don’t forget to spread the gratitude, man:

```plaintext
get namespace_garden_request
here you go, friend! may your data bloom like wildflowers!

set namespace_garden_request thanks a million, peace and love to you!
OK
```

## Checking the Namespace Vibes 🌸

You can always check the status of a namespace to see who’s tending to it:

```plaintext
get namespace_garden
reserved by dblover42
```

## Groovy Tips for Namespace Harmony 🎶
- **Pick a Unique Name**: Choose something as unique as your spirit animal.
- **Be Cool**: When asking for a namespace, always come in peace and love.
- **Keep It Tidy**: Use your namespace consistently to keep the database garden blooming.
